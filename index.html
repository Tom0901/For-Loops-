        	<p>	A for loop typically defines a variable, then sets some parameters for said variable and then implements a change. In my case the variable i is simply going to be incremented. I'm going to display this visually by having a set of if statements that will show the correct number when i is equal to that number. As the loop happens very quickly I've added a delay to each of the if statements so you can see the effect. Enjoy!
