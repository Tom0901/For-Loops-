     <h1>For Loops! What Are They For?</h1>
     <section id="text">
     	   For loops define a variable, then set a condition for that variable and then generally perform an action. 
     	   In my example the for loop is going to be incremented. I've added an event listener to the button below. So, when you click it (I know you want to!) the for loop will increment "i"(an arbitrary variable) from 1 through to 10 and store those values in memory. I've set up a series of if statements to display any number from 1 to 10 as an image when "i" is equal to it. Finally I added a delay to each of the if statements so you can see the effect. Prepare yourself for some animations!
